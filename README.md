[Learena](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearenaTeachingGame/) is a game that gamificates tests and reviews in-class. It is an RPG turn-based game where the boss gives questions to the players. If a player answers the question right, he attacks the boss. Students must work together to overcome the challenge.

The **Learena Admin** is an Android App created by me to be used by the instructors. Using the app, the instructors will be able to create quizzes that will be used in the game Learena.

If you don't have an account created in Learena, you will be able to create one in the app.
